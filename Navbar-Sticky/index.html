        I recollect that my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of
        tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered
        into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was
        startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness
        around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.
        <br /><br />
        Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it
        inside out and if there was ever anyone looking for an expert in the
        field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that there was
        nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years
        of information painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving
        even an ounce of interest in the topic. <br /><br />
        According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah
        Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939,
        “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for Educational
        purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women
        who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned
        professions.” <br /><br />
        I'm heading back to Colorado tomorrow after being down in Santa Barbara
        over the weekend for the festival there. I will be making October plans
        once there and will try to arrange so I'm back here for the birthday if
        possible. I'll let you know as soon as I know the doctor's appointment
        schedule and my flight plans.
